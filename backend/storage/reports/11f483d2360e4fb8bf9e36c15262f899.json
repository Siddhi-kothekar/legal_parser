The \njagged edges and tear pattern indicate that the strap was subjected to sudden, \nviolent pulling in a lateral direction. This is typical of handbag snatching \nattempts when the victim resists.\n\nThe damage indicates that significant force was applied suddenly, rather than a \ngradual weakening of the strap material. This supports the witness and victim \naccounts of a sudden, violent attack.\n\nThe location of the tear (near attachment point) is exactly where stress would \nbe concentrated during a snatching attempt.\n\n\nFIBER EVIDENCE ANALYSIS:\n────────────────────────\n\nFibers Recovered:     YES - Present on torn strap area\nFiber Type:          Black synthetic fibers\nFiber Count:         12 distinct fibers recovered\nFiber Length:        3-8 mm\nFiber Color:         Black (consistent with black hoodie)\nFiber Composition:   Polyester blend (typical hoodie material)\n\nFiber Source Analysis:\nThe black synthetic fibers are consistent with a black hoodie or similar black \nsynthetic garment. The fiber characteristics match common polyester hoodie \nmaterial sold commercially.\n\nThe fibers likely transferred from the suspect's clothing during the physical \nstruggle and attempted snatching. This is typical trace evidence in violent \nproperty crimes.\n\n\nFINGERPRINT EVIDENCE ANALYSIS:\n────────────────────────────────\n\nFingerprint Search Status: UNSUCCESSFUL\nCondition:                 No usable fingerprints recovered\nReason for Failure:       Evidence contamination\nAnalysis:\nThe handbag strap and surrounding areas were examined for fingerprint evidence \nusing standard enhancement techniques (ninhydrin, iodine fuming, cyanoacrylate).\n\nHowever, no identifiable fingerprints were recovered. This is likely due to:\n1. Contamination from multiple handlers (victim, witness, security guard, police)\n2. Weather exposure (outdoor incident)\n3. Leather surface material (difficult surface for fingerprint recovery)\n4. Time delay between incident and evidence collection\n\nWhile fingerprint evidence would have been valuable, the lack thereof does not \nundermine the strength of other evidence (fiber, CCTV, witness testimony).\n\n\nTRACE EVIDENCE SUMMARY:\n───────────────────────\n\nEvidence Item           | Recovered | Findings\n────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────\nBlack Synthetic Fibers  | YES (12)  | Consistent with black hoodie\nDNA Evidence            | NEGATIVE  | No usable DNA recovered\nBiological Evidence     | NONE      | No blood or other biological evidence\nSoil/Debris             | NONE      | Clean leather surface\nChemical Residue        | NONE      | None detected\n\n\nCOMPARATIVE EVIDENCE:\n───",

The \nscream was clearly in a woman's voice and sounded like she was in distress. It was \nnot just a casual noise—it had an urgency that made me immediately concerned for \nsomeone's safety.\n\nI quickly stepped out onto my balcony to see what was happening. From my vantage point \non the first floor, I could see the rear exit area of the apartment complex. I observed \na man wearing a distinctive black hoodie running towards the main road at a very fast \npace, clearly in a hurry to escape.\n\nThe man had a lean, athletic build and appeared to be relatively young—I would estimate \nin his late 20s or early 30s. His face was partially obscured by the hoodie, but I could \nsee he had a fair complexion and what appeared to be a scar on his left cheek. He was \nwearing blue denim jeans and dark-colored shoes.\n\nAs I watched him run away, I noticed a woman (later identified as Neha Deshmukh) lying \non the ground near the rear exit, crying and seemingly in pain. She appeared to have \nfallen or been pushed. I immediately understood that this young man had likely attacked \nor robbed her, which is why she was screaming and he was fleeing so desperately.\n\nI quickly came down from my balcony and rushed to help her. When I reached her, she was \nholding her right shoulder and elbow, which had visible injuries from the fall. She was \nclearly shocked and traumatized by the incident. I asked her what happened, and she \nexplained that a man had tried to snatch her handbag, pushed her during the struggle, \nand caused her to fall.\n\nI helped her stand up carefully, being mindful of her injuries. I also noticed that her \nhandbag's strap was damaged, consistent with her account of a snatching attempt. She was \nstill holding onto her bag, which suggested she had successfully resisted the thief's \nattempt.\n\nAfter helping her up, I immediately called for the apartment's security guard (Ramesh \nSingh) to come to the rear exit. The security guard arrived within minutes and we provided \nfirst aid comfort and support to Neha while waiting for emergency services.\n\nDuring this time, I looked around the rear exit area and did not see any other suspicious \npersons or items left behind. The area appeared to be the scene of a brief, violent \naltercation.\n\n\nKEY OBSERVATIONS:\n─────────────────\n• Young male, athletic build, estimated 25-30 years old\n• Distinctive black hoodie (primary identifying feature)\n• Blue denim jeans\n• Dark shoes (brand unclear from distance)\n• Visible scar on left cheek (clear identifying mark)\n• Fair complexion\n• Ran away at high speed toward main road\n• No weapon visible, but used physical force (pushing)\n• Appeared to be familiar with the escape route (ran directly toward main road)\n• The man seemed to know the layout of the complex\n\n\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS:\n────────────────────\nTime 21:00 (9:00 PM):    Heard woman screaming from rear exit area\nTime 21:01 (9:01 PM):    Stepped onto balcony and observed man in black hoodie running\nTime 21:02 (9:02 PM):    Observed injured woman on ground, realized assault had occurred\nTime 21:03 (9:03 PM):    Rushed down to help the woman\nTime 21:04 (9:04 PM):    Called security guard to the scene\nTime 21:05 (9:05 PM):    Security guard arrived and we provided assistance\nTime 21:10 (9:10 PM):    Police called and complaint registered\n\n\nSUSPECT DESCRIPTION (DETAILED):\n────────────────────────────────\nAge:                     Approximately 25-30 years\nGender:                  Male\nHeight:                  Approximately 5'8\" to 5'10\" (medium height)\nBuild:                   Lean but athletic/muscular appearance\nComplexion:              Fair/Light\nHair:                    Partially hidden by hoodie, appeared dark brown/black\nFacial Hair:             Could not see clearly due to hoodie\nDistinguishing Marks:    Scar on left ",

The accused attempted to snatch the \ncomplainant's handbag without any provocation or prior interaction.\n\nThe complainant, sensing the threat, attempted to resist and hold onto her handbag. \nA brief struggle ensued during which the accused applied physical force, pushing the \ncomplainant forcefully. The complainant lost her balance and fell to the ground, causing \ninjuries to her right shoulder and elbow.\n\nThe accused, in his attempt to snatch the handbag, managed to partially damage the strap \nof the bag but did not succeed in stealing the handbag due to the complainant's resistance \nand intervention by a nearby witness.\n\nUpon hearing the complainant's screams, nearby resident Rahul Patil came to her assistance. \nThe accused, realizing that help was coming, immediately fled the scene in the direction of \nthe main road and disappeared.\n\nThe complainant was assisted by the witness and the apartment security guard. Emergency \nmedical services were contacted and the complainant was taken to CityCare Hospital for \nmedical examination.\n\nThe incident was reported to the police station at 21:10 hours (9:10 PM).\n\n\nWITNESSES:\n──────────\n1.

The \npresence of a visible scar on the left cheek makes identification possible if suspect \napprehended. The incident's occurrence in a residential complex raises concern about \nsecurity vulnerabilities. The second incident at the same location within 48 hours \nwarrants coordinated investigation with FIR 118/2025.\n\nThe suspect's familiarity with the rear exit (approaching from concealment behind \nparked vehicle) suggests possible prior knowledge of the location, indicating possible \ntargeting or surveillance of the complex.\n\n\nSignature of Investigating Officer:     _____________________\nDate: 16 March 2025\nTime: 21:10 hours\n\nName: Inspector Amit Desai\nBadge No: 4521\nShivaji Nagar Police Station, Pune\n\n---\n\n╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n║                         FORENSIC LAB REPORT                                   ║\n║                    FORENSIC SCIENCE LABORATORY, PUNE                          ║\n╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n\nREPORT REFERENCE:        FR-LAB/2025/121\nCASE REFERENCE:          FIR 121/2025\nREQUESTING AGENCY:       Shivaji Nagar Police Station, Pune\nREPORT DATE/TIME:        17 March 2025, 14:30 hours (2:30 PM)\nEVIDENCE RECEIVED DATE:  16 March 2025, 23:30 hours\nANALYSIS COMPLETED:      17 March 2025, 12:00 hours\n\n\nLAB IDENTIFICATION:\n───────────────────\nLaboratory Name:        Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Pune\nAccreditation:          ISO 17025 Certified\nExaminer:              Dr. Suresh Patel, Forensic Expert\nLicense No:            FORSC-2018-3521\nExperience:            18 years in forensic analysis\nReviewed By:           Dr. Rajesh Kumar, Senior Forensic Officer\nLab Case No:           FSL-2025-007841\n\n\nEVIDENCE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION:\n────────────────────────────────────\n\nExhibit A - Handbag with Damaged Strap\n─────────────────────────────────────\nDescription:           Brown leather handbag, medium size\nStatus on Receipt:      Slightly damaged, strap torn\nSealing Status:        Properly sealed in evidence bag (intact)\nChain of Custody:      Maintained throughout\nCondition at Receipt:   Good, no additional damage in transit\n\n\nDETAILED EXAMINATION & FINDINGS:\n──────────────────────────────────\n\nHANDBAG EXAMINATION:\n────────────────────\n\nVisual Inspection:\n• Material: Genuine brown leather\n• Color: Light brown/tan\n• Estimated Size: Medium (approximately 10\" x 8\" x 4\")\n• Condition: Generally good, appears well-maintained\n• Manufacturing: Professional grade, not counterfeit\n\n\nSTRAP DAMAGE ANALYSIS:\n─────────────────────\n\nDamage Type:          Tear/rupture of leather strap\nLocation:             Approximately 3 cm from attachment point (left side)\nDamage Pattern:       Linear tear, approximately 5-7 cm in length\nTear Characteristics: Jagged edges indicate sudden forceful pulling\nDirection:            Horizontal tear (consistent with lateral pulling force)\nStress Analysis:      Tear shows signs of sudden tensile stress\n\nForensic Assessment:\nThe strap damage is entirely consistent with a forceful snatching attempt. The \njagged edges and tear pattern indicate that the strap was subjected to sudden, \nviolent pulling in a lateral direction. This is typical of handbag snatching \nattempts when the victim resists.\n\nThe damage indicates that significant force was applied suddenly, rather than a \ngradual weakening of the strap material. This supports the witness and victim \naccounts of a sudden, violent attack.\n\nThe location of the tear (near attachment point) is exactly where stress would \nbe concentrated during a snatching attempt.\n\n\nFIBER EVIDENCE ANALYSIS:\n────────────────────────\n\nFibers Recovered:     YES - Present on torn strap area\nFiber Type:          Black synthetic fibers\nFiber Count:         12 distinct fibers recovered\nFiber Length:        3-8 mm\nFiber Color:         Black (consistent with black hoodie)\nFiber Composition:   Polyester blend (typical hoodie material)\n\nFiber Source Analysis:\nThe black synthetic fibers are consistent with a black hoodie or similar black \nsynthetic garment. The fiber characteristics match common polyester hoodie \nmaterial sold commercially.\n\nThe fibers likely transferred from the suspect's clothing during the physical \nstruggle and attempted snatching. This is typical trace evidence in violent \nproperty crimes.\n\n\nFINGERPRINT EVIDENCE ANALYSIS:\n────────────────────────────────\n\nFingerprint Search Status: UNSUCCESSFUL\nCondition:                 No usable fingerprints recovered\nReason for Failure:       Evidence contamination\nAnalysis:\nThe handbag strap and surrounding areas were examined for fingerprint evidence \nusing standard enhancement techniques (ninhydrin, iodine fuming, cyanoacrylate).\n\nHowever, no identifiable fingerprints were recovered. This is likely due to:\n1. Contamination from multiple handlers (victim, witness, security guard, police)\n2. Weather exposure (outdoor incident)\n3. Leather surface material (difficult surface for fingerprint recovery)\n4. Time delay between incident and evidence collection\n\nWhile fingerprint evidence would have been valuable, the lack thereof does not \nundermine the strength of other evidence (fiber, CCTV, witness testimony).\n\n\nTRACE EVIDENCE SUMMARY:\n───────────────────────\n\nEvidence Item           | Recovered | Findings\n────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────\nBlack Synthetic Fibers  | YES (12)  | Consistent with black hoodie\nDNA Evidence            | NEGATIVE  | No usable DNA recovered\nBiological Evidence     | NONE      | No blood or other biological evidence\nSoil/Debris             | NONE      | Clean leather surface\nChemical Residue        | NONE      | None detected\n\n\nCOMPARATIVE EVIDENCE:\n──────────────────────\n\nSuspect Description (from CCTV/Witness):\n• Black hoodie\n• Synthetic material\n• Athletic build\n\nRecovered Fiber Evidence:\n• Black synthetic material\n• Polyester blend\n• Consistent with hoodie material\n\nComparison Result:      CONSISTENT ✓\nProbability:           High degree of consistency with suspect's clothing\n\n\nFORENSIC CONCLUSIONS:\n──────────────────────\n\n1. PRIMARY FINDING:\n   The handbag strap damage is consistent with a forceful snatching attempt. \n   The tear pattern, location, and physical characteristics all support this \n   conclusion.\n\n2. FIBER EVIDENCE:\n   The black synthetic fibers recovered from the handbag are consistent with \n   transfer from a black hoodie worn by the suspect during the violent \n   altercation.\n\n3. INCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION:\n   The forensic evidence supports the following sequence of events:\n   • Suspect approached victim at rear exit\n   • Suspect grabbed handbag with force\n   • Suspect and victim engaged in struggle over handbag\n   • During struggle, fibers fro",
