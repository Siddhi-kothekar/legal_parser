STATEMENT IN FIRST PERSON:
──────────────────────────

On 16 March 2025, at approximately 9:00 PM (21:00 hours), I was in my apartment 
(Flat 101, 1st Floor) when I heard a loud, piercing scream coming from outside. The 
scream was clearly in a woman's voice and sounded like she was in distress. It was 
not just a casual noise—it had an urgency that made me immediately concerned for 
someone's safety.

I quickly stepped out onto my balcony to see what was happening. From my vantage point 
on the first floor, I could see the rear exit area of the apartment complex. I observed 
a man wearing a distinctive black hoodie running towards the main road at a very fast 
pace, clearly in a hurry to escape.

The man had a lean, athletic build and appeared to be relatively young—I would estimate 
in his late 20s or early 30s. His face was partially obscured by the hoodie, but I could 
see he had a fair complexion and what appeared to be a scar on his left cheek. He was 
wearing blue denim jeans and dark-colored shoes.

As I watched him run away, I noticed a woman (later identified as Neha Deshmukh) lying 
on the ground near the rear exit, crying and seemingly in pain. She appeared to have 
fallen or been pushed. I immediately understood that this young man had likely attacked 
or robbed her, which is why she was screaming and he was fleeing so desperately.

I quickly came down from my balcony and rushed to help her. When I reached her, she was 
holding her right shoulder and elbow, which had visible injuries from the fall. She was 
clearly shocked and traumatized by the incident. I asked her what happened, and she 
explained that a man had tried to snatch her handbag, pushed her during the struggle, 
and caused her to fall.

I helped her stand up carefully, being mindful of her injuries. I also noticed that her 
handbag's strap was damaged, consistent with her account of a snatching attempt. She was 
still holding onto her bag, which suggested she had successfully resisted the thief's 
attempt.

After helping her up, I immediately called for the apartment's security guard (Ramesh 
Singh) to come to the rear exit. The security guard arrived within minutes and we provided 
first aid comfort and support to Neha while waiting for emergency services.

During this time, I looked around the rear exit area and did not see any other suspicious 
persons or items left behind. The area appeared to be the scene of a brief, violent 
altercation.

                         Blue denim jeans (appeared newer/well-maintained)
                         Dark shoes (possibly sports shoes)

Gait:                    Running at high speed, appeared trained/athletic
Behavior:                Aggressive, desperate to escape, showed no remorse


SUSPECT'S LIKELY DIRECTION OF ESCAPE:
───────────────────────────────────────
The man ran directly from the rear exit toward the main road (FC Road) at high speed. 
He did not attempt to hide or go back into the complex. This suggests he was not 
familiar with escape routes inside the complex but knew the external geography.


ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM'S INJURIES:
─────────────────────────────────
The complainant had visible bruising and pain in her right shoulder and elbow, 
consistent with a fall caused by forceful pushing. She was crying and trembling, 
indicating she was severely shaken by the incident.


ASSESSMENT OF CRIME:
──────────────────────
This was clearly a premeditated or at least opportunistic violent crime involving:
• Attempted theft of personal property (handbag snatching)
• Use of physical force and intimidation
• Attack on a woman in a vulnerable location
• Fleeing to avoid detection and arrest


SUSPECT'S MODUS OPERANDI (MO):
────────────────────────────────
• Approached victim from concealment (had been waiting or hiding)
• Acted suddenly without warning
• Used physical force when victim resisted
• Fled immediately when help arrived
• Knew the location's geography (took most direct escape route)
• Appeared young and fit, suggesting repeated similar crimes possible


PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF SUSPECT:
────────────────────────────
I have never seen this man in or around the Sai Apartment complex before this incident. 
However, his knowledge of the rear exit location and the escape route suggests he may 
have been observing the complex or is familiar with similar targeted attacks.


STATEMENT AUTHENTICITY:
───────────────────────
I hereby declare that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my 
knowledge and belief. I am willing to appear in court and testify regarding this 
incident. I take full responsibility for the accuracy of my observations and 
identifications.
