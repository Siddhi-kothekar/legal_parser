Type:                     Shoulder sprain (Grade I-II) + Elbow contusion
Severity:                 Simple Hurt (per IPC definition)
Causation:               Consistent with violent push causing fall
Pattern Analysis:        Pattern consistent with assault account

  • No fracture or dislocation
  • Soft tissue swelling noted
  • Normal shoulder joint alignment
  • Impression: Soft tissue injury, no bony involvement

Clinical Ultrasound (Optional):

TREATMENT PROVIDED:
────────────────────
1. Ice application for 20 minutes (pain and swelling management)
2. Analgesia: Paracetamol 500mg + Ibuprofen 400mg orally
3. Anti-inflammatory: Ibuprofen 400mg, thrice daily for 5 days
4. Muscle relaxant: Chlorzoxazone 500mg, twice daily for 3 days
5. Supportive bandaging with elastic wrap for immobilization
6. Local anesthetic gel applied to bruised areas
7. Psychological support and counseling provided
8. Sleep aid: Melatonin 3mg tablet offered


DOCTOR'S CLINICAL OPINION:
──────────────────────────
The injuries observed are entirely consistent with a forceful push causing the patient 
to fall or impact against a hard surface. The pattern of bruising on the shoulder and 
elbow suggests direct impact from an assailant's push combined with impact from the 
ground.

The injuries are compatible with the patient's account of being pushed during a handbag 
snatching attempt. There is no evidence of any other mechanism causing these injuries.

The patient is stable and poses no immediate medical risk. Primary concern is the 
psychological trauma from the violent assault.


PROGNOSIS:
──────────
With appropriate wound care and medication compliance, complete healing is expected 
within 5-7 days. The shoulder sprain should resolve completely with conservative 
management.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
─────────────────
1. Rest and activity restriction for 3-5 days
2. Ice application intermittently for pain management
3. Continue prescribed medications for pain and inflammation
4. Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 1 week
5. Gentle range of motion exercises after 48 hours
6. Follow-up visit after 5 days to assess healing progress
7. Seek medical attention if pain worsens or new symptoms develop
8. Psychological counseling recommended for trauma processing
9. Contact for support resources related to assault victim assistance
10. File victim impact statement with police if desired

────────────────────
