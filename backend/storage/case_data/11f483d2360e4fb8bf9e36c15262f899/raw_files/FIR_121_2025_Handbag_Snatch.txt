INCIDENT NARRATIVE:
──────────────────

On 16 March 2025, at approximately 21:00 hours (9:00 PM), the complainant Neha Deshmukh 
was returning home from office work and walking towards the rear exit of Sai Apartment 
Complex on FC Road, Pune.

As she approached the rear exit, an unknown male wearing a black hoodie and blue jeans 
suddenly emerged from behind a parked vehicle. The accused attempted to snatch the 
complainant's handbag without any provocation or prior interaction.

The complainant, sensing the threat, attempted to resist and hold onto her handbag. 
A brief struggle ensued during which the accused applied physical force, pushing the 
complainant forcefully. The complainant lost her balance and fell to the ground, causing 
injuries to her right shoulder and elbow.

The accused, in his attempt to snatch the handbag, managed to partially damage the strap 
of the bag but did not succeed in stealing the handbag due to the complainant's resistance 
and intervention by a nearby witness.

Upon hearing the complainant's screams, nearby resident Rahul Patil came to her assistance. 
The accused, realizing that help was coming, immediately fled the scene in the direction of 
the main road and disappeared.

The complainant was assisted by the witness and the apartment security guard. Emergency 
medical services were contacted and the complainant was taken to CityCare Hospital for 
medical examination.

The incident was reported to the police station at 21:10 hours (9:10 PM).

CASE ANALYSIS & OBSERVATIONS:
──────────────────────────────
• Second incident in Sai Apartment complex within 2 days
• Same security guard (Ramesh Singh) involved in both cases
• Same location (Sai Apartment, FC Road, Pune)
• Different crime type but same neighborhood
• Possible pattern or organized targeting of residents
• Recommend increased security measures in complex
• Possible relationship between incidents to be investigated


INVESTIGATING OFFICER'S REMARKS:
────────────────────────────────
This appears to be a case of attempted theft involving criminal force and intimidation. 
The suspect is young, athletic, and showed no hesitation in using physical force. The 
presence of a visible scar on the left cheek makes identification possible if suspect 
apprehended. The incident's occurrence in a residential complex raises concern about 
security vulnerabilities. The second incident at the same location within 48 hours 
warrants coordinated investigation with FIR 118/2025.

The suspect's familiarity with the rear exit (approaching from concealment behind 
parked vehicle) suggests possible prior knowledge of the location, indicating possible 
targeting or surveillance of the complex.
